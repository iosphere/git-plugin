<div>
  Specify the branches if you'd like to track a specific branch in a repository.
  If left blank, all branches will be examined for changes and built.<br/>
  <br/>
  The syntax is of the form: <tt>REPOSITORYNAME/BRANCH</tt>.
  In addition, <tt>BRANCH</tt> is recognized as a shorthand of <tt>*/BRANCH</tt>, '*' is recognized as a wildcard,
  and '**' is recognized as wildcard that includes the separator '/'. Therefore, <tt>origin/branches*</tt> would
  match <tt>origin/branches-foo</tt> but not <tt>origin/branches/foo</tt>, while <tt>origin/branches**</tt> would
  match both <tt>origin/branches-foo</tt> and <tt>origin/branches/foo</tt>.<br/>
  <br/>
  If you are using namespaces to structure branches (e.g. feature1/master, or team1/requestA/rel-1.0) you have to
  specify the full branch specifier (including "remotes/"): <tt>remotes/REPOSITORYNAME/BRANCH/WITH/NAMESPACE</tt>.<br/>
  E.g. "remotes/origin/feature1/master"
