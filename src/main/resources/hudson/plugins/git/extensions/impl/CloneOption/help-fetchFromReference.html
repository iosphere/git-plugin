<div>
  If the path to a reference repo is specified, enabling this option will also
  use that local repository for each git fetch operation after the initial
  clone.
  <p/>
  This rewrites the URL used in the <code>git fetch</code> command, so that
  Jenkins can pull updates from a repository mirrored locally, rather than
  having to fetch from the configured remote repository URL.<br/>
  <p/>
  This option will be ignored if the path is not available on the machine where
  the clone operation is being executed.
  <p/>
  <b>Note:</b> This requires that the contents of the local reference repository
  are kept up-to-date with remote repository, otherwise Jenkins will see no
  changes.<br/>
  <b>Note:</b> If this option is enabled, currently you will not be able to use
  variables in the path to the reference repo.
