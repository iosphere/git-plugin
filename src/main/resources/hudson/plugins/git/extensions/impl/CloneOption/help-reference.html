<div>
  Specify a directory path to a local mirror that will be used during
  clone operations, e.g. <code>/opt/my git mirror/some-project.git</code><br/>
  Variables in the form <code>$VARIABLE</code> or <code>${VARIABLE}</code> will
  be expanded as appropriate at build time.
  <p/>
  When a valid path is specified, cloning from a "reference" repository should
  be faster and consume less disk space than cloning solely from the configured
  remote repository URL.<br/>
  See the <code>git clone --reference</code> documentation for more information.
  <p/>
  This option will be ignored if the given directory does not exist on the
  machine where the clone operation is being executed.
